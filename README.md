Space shoot'em up game that I have made in under 2 weeks using TypeScript and Pixi.js only.

When the menu appears, you can select either Game1, Game2 or Game3 to start the game, but selecting any of them will 
take you to the same playground, they are just there to set the state of the game. 

When the game is in play mode, you can pause the game by clicking on the pause button in the bottom right corner, 
which will also bring up a panel that allows you to either continue, stop, or restart the game.

Your mission in the game is to shoot down the incoming aliens, whose speed will increase for every 10 scores you do.

Controls: arrow keys move the player, and pressing the space bar will shoot missles.

Before you play, some steps to perform on the root directory of the program:
1. npm install
2. npm start
3. start a local http server
